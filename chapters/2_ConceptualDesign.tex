\section{CONCEPTUAL DESIGN METHODOLOGY}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The conceptual design methodology for solar-powered UAVs used in this paper relies on the work in~\cite{Noth_PhD,Leutenegger_JIRS}. It is extended to include uncertainty in local meteorological conditions such as clouds or winds.

\subsection{System Model} \label{sec:ConceptualDesignMethodology}

%%%Added Proposition to include level flgiht and climbing strategy KR
The general approach for perpetual endurance for LALE-UAVs is to fly level at low altitude while charging the batteries to be energy efficient. When the batteries are fully charged, the excess energy is used to climb and gain potential energy.
%%%
To analyze flight performance the energy input/output-balance under the assumption of level flight at lowest admissible altitude is modeled. The total required nominal electrical output power
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:P_out}
P_{out}^{\,nom}=\frac{P_{level}}{\eta_{prop}}+P_{av}+P_{pld}
\end{equation}
consists of the required electrical propulsion power for level-flight $\frac{P_{level}}{\eta_{prop}}$, where $\eta_{prop}$ includes propeller, gearbox, motor, and motor-controller efficiency, and the necessary avionics and payload power $P_{av}$ and $P_{pld}$. The UAV is assumed to fly at the airspeed of minimum aerodynamic level-flight power
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:P_level}
P_{level}=\left(\frac{C_D}{C_L^\frac{3}{2}}\right)_{min}\sqrt{\frac{2(m_{tot}g)^3}{\rho(h)A_{wing}}} .
\end{equation}
Here, $m_{tot}=m_{bat}+m_{struct}+m_{prop}+m_{sm}+m_{av}+m_{pld}$ is the total airplane mass, where structure, propulsion and solar module masses $m_{struct}$, $m_{prop}$, $m_{sm}$ are %automatically sized according to \cite{Noth_PhD,Leutenegger_JIRS}
optimized and $m_{av}$, $m_{pld}$ are given in Table~\ref{tab:ConceptDesignParameters}. The local earth gravity is designated by $g$, $A_{wing}$ is the wing area, and $\rho(h)$ is the altitude dependent air density. The airplane lift and drag coefficients $C_L$ and $C_D$ are retrieved from 2-D airfoil simulations using XFoil \cite{Drela_XFoil}, with $C_D$ being combined with parasitic drag from the airplane fuselage and stabilizers and the induced drag  
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:C_D}
C_{D,ind}=\frac{C_L^2}{\pi\cdot e_0\cdot\lambda} .
\end{equation}
Here, $e_0\approx0.92$ is the Oswald efficiency and $\lambda$ the wing aspect ratio. On the input side, the nominal solar input power
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:P_solar}
P_{solar}^{\,nom}=I\cdot A_{sm}\cdot\eta_{sm}\cdot\eta_{mppt}
\end{equation}
considers the solar module area $A_{sm}=f_{sm}\cdot A_{wing}$ with relative fill-factor $f_{sm}$, module efficiency $\eta_{sm}$, and Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) efficiency $\eta_{mppt}$. The solar radiation $I=I(\varphi,h,t)$ is assumed to be a function of the geographical latitude $\varphi$, the altitude $h$, and the current date and local time $t$, and is modeled as in \cite{Duffie_SolarEngineering}.
While the batteries are not fully charged ($E_{bat} < E_{bat}^{max}$), the energy balance may be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:EnergyBalance}
\begin{array}{r@{}l}
\frac{dE_{bat}}{dt}&=P_{solar}(\varphi,h,t)-P_{el}-P_{av}-P_{pld} .
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:StateEquations}
%\begin{array}{r@{}l}
%\frac{dE_{bat}}{dt}&=P_{solar}(\varphi,h,t)-P_{el}-P_{av}-P_{pld},\\
%\frac{dh}{dt}&=\frac{\eta_{prop}\cdot P_{el}-P_{level}(h)}{m_{tot}g} .
%\end{array}
%\end{equation}
Here, $P_{el}$ is the current electrical power sent to the propulsion system and $P_{solar}$ denotes the incoming solar power. Further, the altitude state equation is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dhdt}
\begin{array}{r@{}l}
\frac{dh}{dt}&=\frac{\eta_{prop}\cdot P_{el}-P_{level}(h)}{m_{tot}g} .
\end{array}
\end{equation}
By integration of the differential equations in (\ref{eqn:EnergyBalance}) and (\ref{eqn:dhdt}), the energy stored in the batteries may be obtained and thus the perpetual flight capability of the UAV determined.

For the design optimization, we assume that a solar-powered UAV configuration is designed for missions at and around a specific Date of the Year (DoY) and geographical latitude $\varphi$, thus $\varphi$ and $DoY$ are fixed. The three design parameters are a) wingspan $b$ and b) wing aspect ratio $\lambda$, which both specify wing geometry and thus influence level-power (\ref{eqn:P_level}) and solar input power (\ref{eqn:P_solar}), and c) the battery mass $m_{bat}$ contained in $m_{tot}$ in (\ref{eqn:P_level}).

\subsection{Extension of Conceptual Design Optimization Criteria}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\label{sec:ExtensionOptCriteria}
The conceptual design tool developed in \cite{Noth_PhD,Leutenegger_JIRS} has been extended in two ways: First, it now provides the capability to perform energetic simulations of multi-day solar-powered flight, whereas before only one day-night cycle was considered. Figure \ref{fig:EnergySimulation} shows the results for incoming solar power $P_{solar}$, required power $P_{out}$, and remaining battery charge $E_{bat}$ obtained for a flight of two subsequent day-night cycles. Clearly, the initial charge condition $E_{bat}$ at time of sunrise $t_{sr}=\min(t(P_{solar}>0))$ for the second day is different than on the first day, which significantly influences the re-charging process. 
\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/2_EnergySimulation.pdf}
    \caption{Exemplary energetic simulation of the \textit{AtlantikSolar} UAV configuration ($b=5.6m$, $\lambda=18.5$, $m_{bat}=3.5kg$), showing input and output power, battery capacity, and performance metrics excess time $t_{exc}$ and charge margin $t_{cm}$ during a 2-day flight.}
    \label{fig:EnergySimulation}
\end{figure}
Second, and more importantly, the optimization criteria are extended to achieve a more robust multi-day flight. In general, a necessary and sufficient condition for perpetual flight is that the excess time $t_{exc}>0$, where
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:t_exc}
t_{exc}=\frac{E_{bat}(t=t_{eq})}{P_{out}^{\,nom}} \Big| _{P_{solar}(t>t_{sr})=0}
\end{equation}
with \textit{power-equality time} $t_{eq}=t(P_{solar}^{\,nom}=P_{out}^{\,nom})$ in the morning. This means that remaining battery capacity has to exist at $t=t_{eq}$ to continue flight for instance in case of cloud coverage. Therefore, the authors in \cite{Noth_PhD,Leutenegger_JIRS} focus on maximizing $t_{exc}$. However, a large $t_{exc}$ does not provide direct robustness against disturbances in $P_{solar}$ e.g. due to cloud obstruction during the charging process. In contrast, when optimizing purely for $t_{exc}$, the methodology in Sec. \ref{sec:ConceptualDesignMethodology} will select the largest battery size (due to the scaling of $P_{level}$ with $m_{bat}$) which can be fully charged under optimal conditions, but every reduction in $P_{solar}$ will directly decrease $t_{exc}$ due to only partially charged batteries. Thus, we introduce the charge margin $t_{cm}$ as the time margin between achieving the full charge $E_{bat}=E_{bat}^{\,max}$ and restart of the discharge in the evening. In case of decreased solar power income, $t_{cm}>0$ provides additional margin before a decrease in excess time occurs.

The overall approach for increasing robustness with respect to local power disturbances is thus to determine the lowest acceptable $t_{exc}$ satisfying the UAV application requirements, and then to optimize the configuration for $t_{cm}$. The exact procedure applied is:

This conceptual design methodology is applied below. An alternative conceptual design approach utilizing a weighted version of $t_{exc}$ and $t_{cm}$ is proposed in \cite{Morton_ICRA2013}.

\subsection{Application of Conceptual Design Methodology} \label{sec:ConceptDesignApplication}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textit{AtlantikSolar} operates at a nominal latitude of $\varphi=45\degree N$ and shall provide perpetual endurance within a +/-2 month window around $DoY_{nom}$=June 21\textsuperscript{st} (April 21\textsuperscript{st}-August 21\textsuperscript{st}). From \cite{Duffie_SolarEngineering},we find $t_{night}^{\,min}=8.7h$ (June 21\textsuperscript{st}), $t_{night}^{\,max}=10.5h$(April 21\textsuperscript{st}), and thus $t_{exc,DoY}=1.80h$. We choose $t_{exc,clouds}=3.0h$ to account for three hours of full cloud coverage either on the evening or the morning and choose $t_{exc,P_{level}}=0.2\cdot t_{night,max}=2.1h$ to cover increased power consumption due to modeling errors, downdrafts or headwinds. Using $t_{exc,req}=t_{exc,DoY}+t_{exc,clouds}+t_{exc,P_{level}}$, we retrieve $t_{exc,req}=6.9h$ as the minimum required excess time for robust perpetual flight at the given dates and locations. 

The design methodology tool of Section \ref{sec:ConceptualDesignMethodology} is now applied assuming the fixed parameters in Table \ref{tab:ConceptDesignParameters}. Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeChargeMargin} shows the resulting plot for $t_{exc}$ versus the optimization variables $b$ and $m_{bat}$. The subset $\pazocal{S}$ of configurations satisfying $t_{exc}>t_{exc,req}$ is the region within the blue contour-line. The optimum clearly occurs at large wingspans. However, considering that we aim for a small-scale and hand-launchable configuration that allows easy transportation (in this case via disassembly of the main wing into three pieces of less than $2m$ wingspan) we choose $b=5.6m$.  The aspect ratio $\lambda=18.5$ is found to provide an optimum in $t_{exc}$ and also allows to seamlessly integrate the 125mm-wide solar cells (see Section \ref{secsec:Airframe and hardware}) inside the wing chord. The last design choice is $m_{bat}$, for which we seek to optimize $t_{cm}$ within the previously selected set $\pazocal{S}_i=(\pazocal{S}|_{b=5.6m, \lambda=18.5})$. As visible in Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeChargeMargin}, $m_{bat}=3.0...7.5kg$ lies within $\pazocal{S}_i$. We choose $m_{bat}=3.5kg$ to optimize $t_{cm}$ and due to practical battery sizing constraints described in Section \ref{secsec:Airframe and hardware}. The selected final configuration $\pazocal{S}_f=(\pazocal{S}|_{m_{bat}=3.5kg, b=5.6m, \lambda=18.5})$ yields an estimated $m_{tot}=7.22kg$, $t_{exc}=7.89h$ and $t_{cm}=8.38h$ for the nominal operating date and latitude.

\subsection{Robustness Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To verify the multi-day flight robustness of the developed UAV configuration, we analyze its performance considering a set of local disturbances in UAV power input and output, namely
 \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The disturbed solar power income $P_{solar}^{\,dist}$, as caused by clouds or fog. Lacking knowledge of the exact spatial and temporal disturbance distribution, we assume
\begin{equation}
P_{solar}^{\,dist}(t) = P_{solar}^{\,nom}(t) \cdot k_{CCF}.
\end{equation}
Here, $k_{CCF} \in (0,1]$  represents the current cloud cover factor \cite{Kimura_SolarRadAndClouds}, i.e. the clearness of the atmosphere.
\item The disturbed electrical power output $P_{out}^{\,dist}$. Wind downdrafts, head wind, or gusts may require increased propulsion or actuation power. Again, we assume 
\begin{equation}
P_{out}^{\,dist}(t) = P_{out}^{\,nom}(t) \cdot k_{OPF},~k_{OPF} \in (0,1)
\end{equation}
with $k_{OPF}$ representing the Output Power Factor.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}

    \caption{Excess time under disturbed power input and output for the $b=5.6m$, $\lambda=18.5$ configuration: a) $m_{bat}$=3.5kg on June 21\textsuperscript{st} b) $m_{bat}=6.0kg$ on June 21\textsuperscript{st} c) $m_{bat}$=3.5kg on April 21\textsuperscript{st} d) $m_{bat}=6.0kg$ on April 21\textsuperscript{st} }
    \label{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness} shows the remaining excess time with respect to these disturbances. The UAV configuration developed in Section \ref{sec:ConceptDesignApplication} ($m_{bat}=3.5kg$) still provides perpetual endurance with less than 50\% of the solar power income or if more than 60\% increased power are required on June 21\textsuperscript{st} (Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness}a). In contrast, a configuration purely optimized towards excess time ($m_{bat}=6.0kg$, Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness}b) will yield a higher maximum $t_{exc}$ of 9.5h, but the robustness with respect to clouds or higher required level power is greatly decreased. On April  21\textsuperscript{st}, the UAV configuration of Section \ref{sec:ConceptDesignApplication} still provides solid robustness (Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness}c), which verifies the $DoY^{\,nom}\pm$ 2 months perpetual endurance requirement. In contrast, the $m_{bat}=6.0kg$ configuration (Figure \ref{fig:ExcessTimeRobustness}d) can not provide reliable perpetual endurance anymore. Overall, the configuration developed using the extended optimization criteria from Section \ref{sec:ExtensionOptCriteria} thus shows significantly improved multi-day flight robustness in comparison with configurations that are purely optimized for maximum excess time.
