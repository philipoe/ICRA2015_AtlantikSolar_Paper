%AS-P: 39 flights, 24 this summer
%AS-S1: 9 flights, 9 this summer
A total of 79 hours of flight testing have been performed in 46 flights with the two AtlantikSolar UAVs designed and built at ETH Zurich so far. The following section briefly summarizes the main results required and obtained for efficient long-endurance flight and application of the platform in Search-And-Rescue missions.

    \label{fig:PowerMeasurements}
\end{figure}

To verify the energetic UAV modeling in Sec. \ref{sec:ConceptualDesignMethodology}, constant-altitude loitering flights performed in calm air (see Sec. \ref{sec:12hFlight}) were used to record the power curve (Fig. \ref{fig:PowerMeasurements}) for AtlantikSolar. Although a significant portion of noise remains, it can be stated that $P_{Out}^{\,min}\approx42...48W$ at $v_{air}^{\,opt}=9.7\pm0.5m/s$. The modeling through (\ref{eqn:P_out})-(\ref{eqn:C_D}) yielded $P_{out}=44.5W$ for AtlantikSolar. This correspondance means that - on the output power side - the predicted 24h-flight capability and excess time are verified. However, it should be noted that the low power consumption from Fig. \ref{fig:PowerMeasurements} was only reached after significant re-iterations on propeller, motor- and motor-controller design through wind-tunnel and lab tests. In general, the modeling through (\ref{eqn:P_out})-(\ref{eqn:C_D}) is an absolute lower limit for power consumption as it assumes undisturbed flight at minimum sink airspeed, whereas in reality deviations in airspeed and attitude or even downdrafts can not be avoided.

\subsubsection{Autopilot operation in challenging wind conditions}

\begin{figure}[tb]

    \caption{Fully autonomous flight in constant altitude-reference loitering mode under the influence of significant thermal updrafts and winds.

Right: A zoomed-in section of the left plot gives insight into attitude reference tracking.} 
    \label{fig:ControlTestFlight}
\end{figure}

Challenging wind conditions strain a UAV's state estimation and control capabilities, and an excerpt from a fully autonomous verification flight of AtlantikSolar under these conditions is thus shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ControlTestFlight}. The aircraft is in constant altitude-reference loiter mode, and after hitting a thermal at $t=9760s$ it correctly switches off the motor, keeps $\theta_{ref}$ due to the implemented thermal compliance (Sec. \ref{sec:Control}) and thus gains altitude. When the altitude is above the user-prescribed $h_{max}$, negative pitch reference is prescribed and successfully tracked. The aircraft however continues to gain altitude due to the significant updraft strength. From $t=10052s$ on, the autopilot thus engages the spoilers at $h>h_{max}+50$ to achieve maximum descent rate. The aircraft's altitude begins to stabilize and the spoilers are disengaged at $t=10357s$. After a total of 20minutes of unpowered flight, the altitude stabilizes around $h=h_{ref}$ again, with the controller now commanding high throttle due to the following downdraft.

\subsection{Continuous 12-hour Flight} \label{sec:12hFlight}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
%[PHILIPP]
\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/12hFlight}
    \caption{A 12h 22min flight performed by AtlantikSolar to test the endurance under night-flight conditions, i.e. without solar power income. The red-dotted lines are (a) the mean of the output power (59W) over the whole flight in the power plot and (b) the battery voltage at maximum/minimum state-of-charge in the voltage plot.} 
    \label{fig:12hFlight}
\end{figure}

As a first step towards demonstrating multi-day flights, AtlantikSolar performed a 12 hour 22 minutes (276km ground distance) flight under replicated night-conditions (Fig. \ref{fig:12hFlight}), i.e. with the solar power system completely disabled. After launch at 7.15am ($t=0h$), the UAV performs autonomous constant-altitude loitering to execute the power measurements of Sec. \ref{secsec:LevelFlightPower} and a switch to autopilot-assisted (SAS\&CAS) modes for additional testing at $t=4.1h$. The whole flight is marked by severe thermal down- and updrafts with altitude gains up to 350m, with the significant difference between airspeed and GPS-velocity showing horizontal winds on the order of the airspeed (up to 11m/s) for $t>4h$. Although the average power consumption of 59W is higher than determined in Sec. \ref{secsec:LevelFlightPower}, the batteries still show a remaining state of charge (SoC) of ca. 23\% (corresponding to $V_{Bat}$=20.6V) after landing. Simple extrapolation using the remaining SoC shows that flight times of $t_{endurance}=15h$ (and even more in calmer conditions) are possible solely on batteries. Crossing the night for the full operating range defined in Sec. \ref{sec:ConceptDesignApplication} and involving $t_{night}^{\,max}=10.5h$ on April 21\textsuperscript{st} thus seems possible with excess times of $t_{exc}>4.5h$. This supports the findings of the conceptual design.
