 \section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}
 %PHILIPP]
 - mention Total flight hours, total flights. Mention that 2 AtlantikSolars have already been built \& flown.  Range of weather conditions?
 \subsection{Subsystem level results}
 %[PHILIPP]. If not already done in the sections before.
    - power efficiency curves. P\_level from Test flights.
    - solar power system and rechargin of batteries?
    - control results? [if not already shown before].   - control:   - SE\&Control: PID performance over various trim points. PID computational requirements (low!)
  \subsection{Continuous 12hour Flight}
  %[PHILIPP]
  \subsection{Mapping Flights in Search and Rescue scenarios}
  %[DRALEXIS]
    - mapping missions in ICARUS. 
    - REF to Separate paper??? Yes, but only once both are accepted.
    - some cool pics/reconstructed maps
