\section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   
%PHILIPP]
 - mention total flight hours, total flights. Mention that 2 AtlantikSolars have already been built \& flown.  Range of weather conditions?
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subsystem level results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
%[PHILIPP]. If not already done in the sections before.
   - power efficiency curves. P\_level from Test flights. Comparison to conceptual design. Describe why power consumption not optimal: e.g. because optimal CD/CL\^1.5 assumed, but this has a) to be met in average and b) even then fluctuations as seen in flight tests are on the order of 2-3 degrees in AOA or +/- 1m/s, so this will never be met perfectly.
 - solar system operation and recharge of batteries
 - state estimation (if not shown before)
 - control (if not shown before):   - SE\&Control: PID performance over various trim points. PID computational requirements (low!)

\subsection{Continuous 12hour Flight}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
%[PHILIPP]
   - focus on battery performance. Say that even more possible (mention some results from the lab tests)
   - explain how much autonomous, under which conditions.

\subsection{Mapping Flights in Search and Rescue scenarios}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   
%[DRALEXIS]
    - mapping missions in ICARUS. 
    - REF to Separate paper??? Yes, but only once both are accepted.
    - some cool pics/reconstructed maps
