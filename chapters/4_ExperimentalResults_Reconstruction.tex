%	This subsection presents some example results of the MeF ICARUS Field Testing for the AtlantikSolar System Overview paper

The AtlantikSolar is an integral part of several European projects and among them it represents the Endurance Airplane of the ICARUS Search--and--Rescue (SAR) project~\cite{ICARUSwebsite}. Within that framework, AtlantikSolar recently participated in the field--trials event of this project that took place in Marche--en--Famenne, Belgium. During these field--trials, several of the platform capabilities were presented and especially the ability to operate over long durations as required by the SAR teams, collect aerial data that can be utilized for mapping purposes as well as capture thermal images to provide information on possible victims. The sensor pod mentioned in section~\ref{sec:detailed_design} was onboard AtlantikSolar recording pose--annotated visible--light grayscale and thermal images from an HDR global shutter camera (Aptina MT9V034) and a FLIR Tau2 respectively. Furthermore, a Sony HDR-AS100VW camera with GPS tagging was also carried onboard. Via the execution of pre--planned missions that ensured the complete coverage of a given area with the aforementioned camera systems and the help of the Pix4D software, the pose--annotated images enabled the dense reconstruction of $3\textrm{D}$ models of the area. Figure~\ref{fig:mef_icarus_reconstruction}.

The derived maps come with geoinformation while a small amount of highly--accurate ground control points (GCPs) can highly improve the georeferencing accuracy and also enable the seamless merging of different point clouds.  }
