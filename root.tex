%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This paper presents the conceptual design, detailed development and flight testing of AtlantikSolar, a 5.6m-class solar-powered low-altitude long-endurance (LALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) designed and built at ETH Zurich. The UAV is required to provide perpetual endurance at a geographic latitude of 45\degree in a 4-month window around June 21\textsuperscript{st}. We present and apply a conceptual design method for maximizing perpetual flight robustness with respect to local meteorological disturbances such as clouds or wind drafts. Airframe, avionics hardware and algorithm development for fully autonomous flight operations is described. Flight test results include a simulated 12-hour night flight relying solely on the aircraft batteries. In addition we present flight results from Search-And-Rescue field trials where a camera and processing pod was mounted on the aircraft to create high-fidelity 3D-maps of the simulated disaster area.

%Abstract. Idea for this paper:
%
% - Conceptual design, realization/integration, development of onboard systems, flight testing and verification of conceptual/preliminary design => Complete cycle including all steps can be shown here.
%   - Demonstrations -> rather basic control approaches chosen, i.e. this platform will be the basis for further research in control, guidance \& navigation, mapping and will go towards the applications of XXX
%    - solar-powered, hand-launchable 5m-class Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with multi-day continuous flight capability combined with payload capacity for long-endurance SAR and inspection missions.
%Questions:
% ``complete cycle'' here, with more details in papers XXX to YYY
% - We ware special : mission applications possible, long endurance, combination

\section*{APPENDIX}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word �acknowledgment� in America is without an �e� after the �g�. Avoid the stilted expression, �One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .�  Instead, try �R. B. G. thanks�. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
