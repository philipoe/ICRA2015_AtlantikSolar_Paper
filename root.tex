This paper presents the conceptual design, detailed development and flight testing of AtlantikSolar, a 5.6m-wingspan solar-powered low-altitude long-endurance (LALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) designed and built at ETH Zurich. The UAV is required to provide perpetual endurance at a geographic latitude of 45\degree in a 4-month window around June 21\textsuperscript{st}. We present and apply a conceptual design method for maximizing perpetual flight robustness with respect to local meteorological disturbances such as clouds or wind drafts. Airframe, avionics hardware and algorithm development for fully autonomous flight operations is described. Flight test results include a simulated 12-hour night flight relying solely on the aircraft batteries. In addition we present flight results from Search-And-Rescue field trials where a camera and processing pod was mounted on the aircraft to create high-fidelity 3D-maps of the simulated disaster area.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This paper presented the design, realization and flight testing of a solar-powered hand-launchable LALE UAV for robust (with respect to meteorological disturbances such as clouds) multi-day flight at 45\degree N geographical latitude from April 21\textsuperscript{st} to August 21\textsuperscript{st}. In-flight power measurements and a 12h 22min flight solely on batteries confirm the expected endurance and hence that flights through the night are possible. However, these performance results required a thorough application of our extended conceptual design methodology and a significant engineering effort especially with respect to improving flight efficiency. Basing upon the available UAV platform, the next steps are to demonstrate one and multiple day-night (24h/48h) flights. Next to long-endurance research, more effort will be put into implementing more online localization, map reconstruction and planning capabilities into the existing optical- and infrared camera pod to increase the autonomy in the Search-and-Rescue projects that the platform is involved in.
