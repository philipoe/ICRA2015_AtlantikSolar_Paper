Abstract. Idea for this paper:

 - Conceptual design, realization/integration, development of onboard systems, flight testing and verification of conceptual/preliminary design => Complete cycle including all steps can be shown here.
   - Demonstrations -> rather basic control approaches chosen, i.e. this platform will be the basis for further research in control, guidance \& navigation, mapping and will go towards the applications of XXX
    - solar-powered, hand-launchable 5m-class Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with multi-day continuous flight capability combined with payload capacity for long-endurance SAR and inspection missions.
Questions:
      - This paper = engineering paper, rest is then BASING upon this paper (use it as a ref). Is this OK? Is the chance that this will be accepted big enough? -> Yes, focus on ``complete cycle'' here, with more details in papers XXX to YYY
 - We ware special : mission applications possible, long endurance, combination

                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{APPENDIX}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word �acknowledgment� in America is without an �e� after the �g�. Avoid the stilted expression, �One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .�  Instead, try �R. B. G. thanks�. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
